  <span class="help-block">An abstract entity that governs the properties within a data center and has the ability to constrain the load on the properties that it governs. Think of a resource as something that can impose a capacity constraint on the load associated with one or more properties in a data center. The goal of resources is to encapsulate the architecture and topology of the network in a data center.</span>
  <span class="help-block">For example, each property normally has an associated resource that represents the capacity of the servers for that property. In addition, there might be a resource that constrains the aggregate bandwidth available to all properties in a data center.</span>
